<h1>CrowdStrike Certified Falcon Responder (CCFR) Exam</h1>

<p>The CrowdStrike Certified Falcon Responder (CCFR) exam is the final step toward the completion of CCFR certification. This exam evaluates a candidate&#39;s knowledge, skills and abilities to respond to a detection within the CrowdStrike Falcon console. The CCFR exam is a 90-minute, 60-question assessment. Exam questions have been specifically written in a way that eliminates tricky wording, double negatives, and/or fill-in-the-blank type questions. This exam passed several rounds of editing by both technical and non-technical experts and has been tested by a wide variety of candidates.</p>

<p><strong>A successful CrowdStrike Certified Falcon Responder:</strong><br />
Conducts initial triage of detections in the Falcon console<br />
Manages filtering, grouping, assignment, commenting and status changes of detections<br />
Performs basic investigation tasks such as host search, host timeline, process timeline, user search and other clickdriven workflows<br />
Conducts basic proactive hunting for atomic indicators such as domain names, IP addresses and hash values across enterprise event data</p>
